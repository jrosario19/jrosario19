## My Story:
I am an Industrial Engineer with more than 15 years of experience in the field of Industrial Engineering, I have worked for important companies in Service, Manufacturing, and logistics. My goal for entering my CV on this platform is to get a job in .NET and Flutter-Dart Technology, taking advantage of the training I received at the Technological Institute of Las Americas (ITLA) in the Dominican Republic. Since my beginning as a professional, I have always been involved in the development of applications to automate tasks from macros in excel using Visual Basic to Html, JavaScript, CSS,  .NET Core MVC and Flutter-Dart.

Since my beginnings as an industrial engineer in 2004 I started programming macros in excel in order to automate tasks, then I realized that I had programming skills and then I started watching web programming tutorials while practicing developing some applications. then I took several programming courses at the Technological Institute of the Americas, these courses were an introduction to programming, C# Basic, and  C# Intermediate. 

I also graduated at Microverse Academic for the full-stack software developers.
